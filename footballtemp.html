                <h2>ðŸ“˜ Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Does weather impact football games more than we think? Specifically, when teams play in temperatures
                    theyâ€™re unaccustomed to, does it negatively affect their performance? This analysis looks at what
                    team on an NFL Sunday is most "out of their element" in terms of weather.</p>
                <p>This project is mostly a data engineering project with a little bit of statistical analysis. The
                    general idea behind it is if one team is significantly better than another, it's naive to assume
                    they'll lose just because they're playing in unfamiliar weather. Instead of making raw predictions,
                    this model builds on the betting lines set by sportsbooksâ€”who already factor in many variables and
                    tend to predict game margins fairly well. The assumption here is that sportsbooks may undervalue
                    weather differences. So, if a team is expected to win by 10 points but is traveling to a location
                    with unfamiliar weather, this model would adjust that margin slightly downward. In short, it adds a
                    small weather-based correction on top of the sportsbook's original prediction using a few hard-coded
                    rules. </p>

                <h2>ðŸ“Š How It Works</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Game Data</strong>: Retrieve the weekâ€™s NFL games using

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Weather Analysis</strong>:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Collect historical weather data for each team's home city from
                                <a href="https://www.visualcrossing.com/" target="_blank"

                            <li>Get the <strong>forecasted kickoff temperature</strong> for each game from

                            </li>
                            <li>Calculate <strong>z-scores</strong> to determine how far the game-time temperature
                                deviates from the teamâ€™s home-city norm.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Results</strong>: The team with the largest absolute z-score is identified as the one
                        most "out of their element" for that week. This result is posted to X (formerly Twitter).
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>ðŸš€ Potential Improvements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Backtesting with Historical Data:</strong> While the model showed some promise during
                        initial tests, it's difficult to assess its true effectiveness without running it against a
                        large set of historical games. Unfortunately, obtaining detailed historical game data alongside
                        corresponding weather conditions, especially from trusted sources, is either costly or
                        restricted,
                        making comprehensive backtesting a challenge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alternative Posting Platform:</strong> Currently, the model posts results to X (formerly
                        Twitter), but integrating with Xâ€™s API has proven to be time-consuming and fragile. Exploring
                        more seamless options like email summaries, a dedicated webpage, or even a lightweight dashboard
                        could improve both reliability and user experience.</li>
