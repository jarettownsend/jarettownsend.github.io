# Jaret Townsend – Portfolio Site

This is my personal portfolio site showcasing a few of the projects I've worked on in data science and data engineering.

> ⚠️ I’m not a frontend developer, and this site is not meant to be a design showcase. I used a great free HTML template to make my work more accessible and visually organized.
