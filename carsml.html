                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>My Car Price Predictor project is a web app built with Streamlit that predicts the market value of a
                    used car
                    based on features like make, model, year, mileage, and condition. Powered by a trained Random Forest
                    Regressor, it gives users quick and reliable pricing estimates drawn from real-world Craigslist
                    listings.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately even after compressing the model, the model is too large to run on Streamlit Cloud. If
                    you'd like to try it for yourself you can clone my <a
                        href="https://github.com/jarettownsend/Car-Price-Predictor" target="_blank">Github Repo</a> and
                    run it locally.</p>

                    <li><strong>Pandas</strong> – for cleaning and manipulating data</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>This project involved significant data wrangling and feature engineering before any modeling could
                    begin.</p>

                <p>The original dataset included a <code>model</code> column that was too messy to use directly. I
                    initially built a version of the model using broader features like <code>type</code> (e.g., SUV,
                    sedan) and <code>size</code> (e.g., mid-size, full-size), which produced decent results. But that’s
                    not how people typically search for cars. Instead, most users think in terms of specific makes and
                    models (like "Toyota Camry" or "Ford F-150").</p>

                <p>So I pivoted and used regex-based pattern matching to extract and combine the <code>make</code> and
                    <code>model</code> fields into a single clean column. This required a lot of manual investigation
                    and iterative cleaning, but it ultimately resulted in a more structured and usable feature
                    representing the most common make-model combinations.
                </p>

                <p>On the modeling side, I started with a basic <strong>Linear Regression</strong>, but it struggled to
                    capture the non-linear patterns in the data. Switching to a <strong>Random Forest Regressor</strong>
                    significantly improved performance and delivered more stable predictions.</p>

                <p>I also experimented with <strong>hyperparameter tuning</strong>, but it didn’t yield the gains I
                    expected—likely because the model was already performing near its ceiling, given the noisy nature of
                    the data. In the end, a well-balanced Random Forest model struck the right trade-off between
                    accuracy and complexity.</p>

                <p>The final model achieved an <strong>R-squared of 0.9247</strong> and an <strong>RMSE of
                        3,542.52</strong>, which means that on average, predictions were off by around $3,500. In
                    context, this is a reasonably strong result—for example, if a car is worth $26,000 and the model
                    predicts $29,500, that’s within an acceptable margin for many use cases.</p>

                <h2>Potential Improvements</h2>

                <h3>Geographic Context</h3>
                <p>
                    Adding location-based features could help capture regional pricing differences. I originally tried
                    to include <code>region</code> as a feature, but it was very messy, and because of how many unique
                    regions there were, it left me with a sparse matrix after encoding. In theory, I could have mapped
                    each region (e.g., "Greensboro", "Florida Keys") to a broader geographic category like "Southeast",
                    but that wasn’t how I wanted to prioritize my time for this project.
                </p>

                <h3>Better Data</h3>
                <p>
                    While I’m mostly happy with the dataset I used, it came with some clear limitations. The biggest
                    issue is that the data is over three years old, which is a long time in the used car market. This
                    likely makes my predictions less accurate in today's pricing environment and also makes it difficult
                    to validate results against current listings on platforms like CarGurus or Kelley Blue Book.
                    Additionally, while my regex-based make/model extraction worked reasonably well, having a dataset
                    with pre-cleaned <code>make</code> and <code>model</code> columns would save a lot of effort and
                    reduce noise.
                </p>

                <h3>Bayesian Modeling</h3>
                <p>
                    One future direction I’m interested in is exploring Bayesian approaches to pricing predictions. A
                    Bayesian model could provide not just point estimates, but also <strong>credible intervals</strong>
                    that reflect the uncertainty around each prediction—something particularly valuable in a noisy
                    domain like used car pricing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tried to approximate this kind of uncertainty by calculating a prediction range using the
                    variation across individual trees in the Random Forest. While this gave a rough interval by
                    estimating a standard error, it's ultimately a statistical shortcut. It assumes things like
                    independence and normality that don’t really apply to decision trees, and it lacks the
                    interpretability and theoretical rigor of true Bayesian methods.
